# Disaster-Tweets-Analyzer-Classification-and-Location-Extraction
The project, "Disaster Tweet Analyzer and Location Extraction," is an end-to-end disaster content classification and relevant location extraction system. It combines classical machine learning with transformer-based natural language processing to improve accuracy and contextual reasoning. The system involves disaster classification (identification of whether a tweet refers to an actual disaster), location extraction (identification and resolution of city names with preference for those in India and prominent global cities), risk assessment (mapping of disasters to locations), batch processing of CSV, and interactive command-line interface with real-time analysis support. Installation of the tool involves cloning the repository, installation of the dependencies listed under requirements.txt, and confirmation of the installation of the spaCy English model (en_core_web_sm)â€”the installation can be conducted directly via pip through a URL or by running the command python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm. The project supports the accommodation of GPU acceleration through PyTorch, if available, and has fallback arrangements in case transformer models are not yet installed. The code structure is modular, with the central logic in your_script.py, comprising training functions for disaster and location models, an end-to-end tweet analysis function, and capabilities for generating summary reports. The tool is intended to be flexible, efficient, and practical to employ for researchers or developers developing systems for disaster monitoring through social media.
